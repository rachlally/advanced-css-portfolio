# Advanced CSS Portfolio
A portfolio of work samples

## Description

This is a portfolio of work samples created by Rachel Lally (me!).  In entering this industry, it will be expected that I can supply a portfolio of work samples so employers can better gage my abilities and skillset.  While this page is still in its early stages, I think it is imporant I begin this process now.  Prior to this project, I did not have an outline for how to present work I have started and completed.  While the projects I included in this sample are still under construction, I now have a place to post once completed.  

I learned more about CSS through this exercise.  In particular, I focused on flexboxes and how they asssit in the alignment of a page.  I utilzed some fun CSS tools like hover and transform to play around with movement.  

## Usage

This page is very user friendly.  The navigation bar located at the top-right of the page will take a user to the section they are interested in exploring.  

Once a user has navigated to the "My Work" section, they are able to click on the image and/or title of my project to link directly to that site.



To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
